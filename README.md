* if __--adult__ is set you will get check answer results person an adult or not yet (18 years old or more).

### Some description
__birthDate__ is set as optional instead of required to get ability to respond with nice formatted text instead of plain error. birthDate is checked with regex.

No routes have been set, __autowire__ and __autoconfigure__ was turned off, services was added manually.
